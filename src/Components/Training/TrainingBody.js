              RMC Lingo’s interdisciplinary language program provides students
              with opportunities to enrich knowledge of a foreign language
              through various disciplines and contexts. By applying foreign
              language skills, students expand their understanding of a certain
              disciplines in the humanities, fine arts, and social sciences and
              also open the door to art, music, dance, fashion, cuisine, film,
              philosophy and science. During the session, a student can pursue
              other foreign language attached to a continuing course that
              highlights a particular subject. RMC Lingo currently offers many
              language programs as German, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic,
              Japanese, etc.
